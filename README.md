# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is central to Neural Networks and Deep Learning - hence learning how to do it from scratch is essential to understand what happends under the hood when using ML libraries.

This notebook will guide you on how to create a logistic-regression from scratch. It will include a forward pass and backpropagation.
